This is a simple TCP client using Qt Network APIs, to show the basic
functions that sends a short string to server. It is based on
(and modified) from Qt tutorial examples available at the Qt web site.

The code (perhaps loosely) follows the
[Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html),
with some exceptions (such as identation).

# Building the code
